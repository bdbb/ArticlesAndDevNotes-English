# Zero-Delay Wallstone Signal Downward Transmission, But Output Is in Entity Phase

Uses armor stand wallstone, only the output uses redstone.

Made this back when I still had time to tinker with redstone-free survival. I figured nobody would need such an abstract component so I didn't publish it. If you can't understand it, just build one and you'll get it.

P.S. I also don't know why the armor stand jumps when built this way

P.P.S. Will add code analysis when I have time; if not added, it means I didn't understand it
