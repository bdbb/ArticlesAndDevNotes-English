# [Essay] How to Efficiently Participate in the Minecraft Technical (TMC) Community?

*This essay is compiled from casual conversations among friends.*

Imagine you are a Minecraft player, but your internet connection is poor so you can only play single-player, and you can barely browse web pages while videos are completely unplayable. In such an environment, if you want to engage with technical content, what's the most effective method? My answer is: join a technical discussion group.

Poor internet means you need to use the network as efficiently as possible, so the quality of information sources becomes very important. Currently, a player wanting continuous exposure to technical content typically has the following information sources:

- Minecraft Wiki
- Bilibili (Chinese video platform)
- QQ groups (Chinese messaging platform)

Minecraft Wiki is a reliable source of information, but it's not specifically designed for technical gameplay, and wikis themselves aren't places for discussion.

Bilibili, despite aggregating game-related videos, hasn't reached an ideal state for player communication due to the nature of video platforms and recommendation algorithm limitations: comment sections and bullet comments (danmaku) are typically responses to the current video and lack real-time interaction; private messages are one-to-one communication, which becomes inconvenient when there are many people; recommendation algorithms cause player interaction opportunities to be influenced by video popularity—low popularity means being ignored, high popularity means mixed quality, and furthermore the algorithm favors new videos, so older videos get "forgotten" by the algorithm over time. Among player communities, you often see complaints about view counts not correlating with technical skill. Considering that recommendation algorithms were never designed for technical players, such contradictions aren't surprising (Bilibili also doesn't have anything like featured/pinned posts).

QQ groups are a good means of player communication, but QQ itself is a relatively closed system where players need external guidance to gather. What are the most visible groups currently? Most are server groups and personal/fan groups, because there's server promotion, showcases, and content creator updates. These groups exist more to handle internal group affairs rather than technical discussion, and a common problem when communicating in these groups is mixed topics with very poor continuity. Due to long-standing design habits of domestic communication software, the phenomenon of one group chat with N topics is especially prominent. If you think deeper, staying in these groups long-term will inevitably draw you into unrelated disputes, which I believe most people wouldn't enjoy.

Since the decline of Tieba (Chinese forum), the main platforms for player communication have been Bilibili and QQ groups. The biggest problem with both is fragmentation: new content production is scattered across various content creators, and player communication is scattered across various closed groups. If you don't rely on any small community's help and only use search, it's very difficult to objectively and comprehensively access the player community. New capable players and groups are also hard for veteran players to discover. The Archive's appearance solved the indexing problem for redstone works, but the indexing problem for communication channels remains unsolved. Although individual efforts can't change this closed environment, at least we can make searching in this area easier: [Minecraft (Survival) Technical Discussion Group Index](https://www.bilibili.com/read/cv23412711). This task would actually be better handled by someone with more influence.

## Side Note

Additionally, as a side note, due to objective life stage limitations in China, generally speaking a player's most active period is 4 years. A group of players only has the opportunity to come together because their active periods overlap, so we can consider a Minecraft player community's most active period to be 4 years. So what date is 4 years before this article's writing date of May 1, 2023? It's 2019, and 4 years before that is 2015. These two times respectively saw the emergence of TIS and Ink-Squid Server. Looking at it this way, this year or next year might see the emergence of the next well-known community. At such a time of transition between old and new, I hope newcomers won't develop feelings of alienation or exclusion just because they're distant from predecessors in time and personal relationships. This isn't a good phenomenon. As stated earlier, the existing player community is already built on a series of non-open and unreasonable foundations. If "variables" like people act this way too, it will only intensify division and conflict, which is something we wouldn't want to see.
